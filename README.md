# EcoDine - Food Waste Management App for Schools

[EcoDine](https://eco-dine.vercel.app/) is a web application designed to help school dining halls reduce food waste and enhance student satisfaction by improving communication between students and kitchen staff. The app collects brief, 10-second surveys from students after each meal, recording their satisfaction levels and the amount of food waste generated. This data is then saved to a database, providing clear visualization and analysis of food waste and student preferences. This process helps dining halls continuously update their menus, make informed decisions, and manage kitchen waste from overproduction.

## Objectives

- **Reduce food waste**: Help dining halls identify the most wasted dishes, and thus make informed decisions to minimize food waste and avoid overproduction.
- **Increase student satisfaction**: Optimize menus to improve the student experience based on their feedback.
- **Promote environmental awareness**: Since students can track their own food waste, it encourages them to be mindful of their environmental footprint.
- **Enhance nutritional awareness**: Help students to track their dietary habits and see how their choices align with recommended dietary guidelines.
- **Streamline inventory operations**: Use data to optimize kitchen inventory management, reducing waste and improving cost efficiency.
